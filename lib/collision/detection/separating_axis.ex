defmodule Collision.Detection.SeparatingAxis do
  @moduledoc """
  Implements the separating axis theorem for collision detection.

  Checks for collision by projecting all of the edges of a polygon
  against test axes, which are the normals of all the edges of
  both polygons that are being tested.

  If there is any axis for which the projections aren't overlapping,
  then the polygons are not colliding with one another. If all of
  the axes have overlapping projections, the polygons are colliding.
